# spotlight_hardware_designs
Here we provide a partial set of hardware designs for a Meta-developed brain computer interface (BCI) research prototype system. 

At a high-level, the BCI system consists of:  
1) a custom 3D-printed headcap 
2) two modules, each of which contains LED sources and SiPM detectors and sits on the headcap
3) a hub, which synchronizes streaming data from multiple modules ultimately to a host computer for further processing

By partial designs, we mean that these are not all the files required to build this exact system. The files are a high-level mechanical and electrical view of the system described above.

Check out [Labgraph](https://github.com/facebookresearch/labgraph), which is a Meta open source software that can be used to stream data from systems like the one described here.
